The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

The place was pretty empty but we were still seated in the very back corner by the kitchen (all the customers were seated against the far wall which felt a bit strange).  After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes for the waitress to come by to take our order.  Throughout dinner, the waitresses were all huddled around the sushi bar chatting with the sushi chefs, and they seemed annoyed any time they needed to check on their customers.  Plus, the music was blasting so loud all night that I could barely have a conversation.\\n\\nThe non-sushi menu is limited and has only the basic chicken teriyaki, etc.  Also, there weren't any combo plates like other places offer.  I ordered a couple of rolls and they were fine (the spicy tuna was actually ok) but they were all covered in not so great sauces that were too salty or sour.  The chicken teriyaki came out on a huge plate and was all breast meat...however, the chicken was very very bland (the chicken appeared steamed and later topped with a little sauce and a pile of green onions).\\n\\nNext time, we'll stick with I Love Sushi...better sushi, better non-sushi, and better prices.

So when searching for a place with an innovative approach to steak, StripSteak should have been a no brainer, right?\\n\\nAs it turned out, StripSteak was a bit of a letdown. The reason, however, is a little hard to pin down. Suffice it to say that I found the restaurant both overwhelming and underwhelming.\\n\\nWhat was overwhelming were the ways in which they attempted to \\\"bribe\\\" you into loving the restaurant. This begins the second you sit down, when they parade out to your table a Trio of Duck Fat Fries. Now who can resist duck fat fries? Clearly I was being manipulated here, and the truffle oil fries did just that. That said, because they bring them out to every table, while lying in wait for their next victim, the fries don't come out as hot and fresh as they could be. In addition to the fries, they also bring out to your table a cast iron pan of potato focaccia bread, which was delicious but dense. All this before even getting our appetizers!\\n\\nFor our meal, we both opted for the prix fixe menu, which is a fair deal at $55.\\n\\n1st Course\\n\\nMaryland Blue Crab Chowder | Bacon Lardon, Parsnip -- Intense crab flavor but a little watery. Not my favorite.\\n\\nBibb Wedge | Avocado, Bacon, Oregon Smokey Blue  -- Good flavor, but I felt like I have had this before. Surprisingly staid for Michael Mina. In fact, both these dishes were really underwhelming.\\n\\n2nd Course\\n\\nSlow-Poached Prime Rib of Beef | Select Seasonal Side Dishes -- The meat was well cooked, but honestly, I have made better prime rib at home. The side dishes consisted of a wonderful brussels sprouts slaw, a predictable truffled mac and cheese, and an insipid creamed spinach.\\n\\nDry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye ($10 surcharge) -- This was delicious, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. Now this is the reason that one comes to a steakhouse, not for all the distractions and bribes. And this is the reason I brought the 2006 Scarecrow Cabernet Sauvignon ($35 corkage), which paired perfectly with the meat.\\n\\n3rd Course\\n\\nMichael's Root Beer Float | Sassafras Ice Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookies  -- Pure yum! I could have had a pitcher of this.\\n\\nFinally, as if this wasn't enough, before you leave and write your Yelp review, they present you with a bag of Chocolate Almond Brittle. Again, a bribe.\\n\\nThe service was for the most friendly and unpretentious, with the exception of the person who came to open and decant our wine (I don't think he was the somm). He seemed a little snotty and did not smile at all.\\n\\nSo would I come back again? Probably not, but I did enjoy some aspects of our meal. The next time I'm in Las Vegas and want to do a Michael Mina restaurant, I'll head to Nobhill Tavern instead.</td>\n",

No! So not only am I disappointed , but also being told to make another trip . This is one of the most completely annoying places that I've been. It's obvious the vegan ice creams are popular, there are silly hand written signs everywhere, do you think maybe you could make a productive sign for the front door saying your out of the vegan flavors before your vegan patrons have to waste their time waiting in line?

Basically it's an ex-music store in a glorified strip mall but the atmosphere is as good as it can be given the circumstances.\\n\\nThe food we can save you a lot of time on: don't bother.  It's expensive and portions are small but not in the good fancy restaurant kind of way.   The crab dip we got for an appetizer was a bit misleading unless you knew that \\\"crab dip\\\" actually meant \\\"heated up mayonnaise\\\".

The flatbread pizza thingy's were ok though but a small portion.\\n\\nDrinks however are a different story.  Lots of beers on tap and bottled.

       "      <td>Took a date here on my mission to try any and all legitimate Italian restaurants in town as new ones pop up. I was slacking on trying Bacio so I finally wanted to check it off my list. Get there for my reservation and Nicole the hostess was friendly and walked us to our 2 top  next to the window over looking the pool. The restaurant looks very Miami with white everywhere. It looks very nice though. \\n\\nThey bring bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the table in what I would describe as a small gravy float. The taste was very good but then  problem is what with the gravy float type container the olive oil and balsamic was in it is impossible to get the correct oil to vinegar ratio because the balsamic sinks to the bottom and the dish is too deep to get the vinegar without the oil washing most of it away. The quality was great but a shallow saucer with the same mixture would be much better. \\n\\nThe serve comes to get our appetizer and drink orders. My date orders a glass of wine (very nice wines on the list) and I order an Aperal Spritz. The server comes back after about a minute and says they are out of the Aperal wine, I pointed out it was a liquor not a wine. He comes back shortly with both drinks. The spritz was made perfectly. The waiter was either new to Bacio or just didnt know his menu very well as there are only like 6 cocktails to choose from.\\n\\nFor appetizers She orders the Cesar and I order the Caprese. She enjoyed the ceasar and the caprese was  good as well. Great quality tomatoes and olive oil with Bufalo mozarella. I wish there was larger pieces of basil though and they were micro slices instead. Different but it didn't really take away from the great quality I just would have loved it more if they had larger pieces of basil. \\n\\nWe order out entrees and she orders the Tagliolini Neri ai Frutti di Mare as she was in the moos for seafood and I order the Salsa Rustica with Spaghetti with Buffalo Mozzarella. We get the dishes after a perfect wait. The portions were fairly generous for the quality of the ingredients. She really liked her Frutti di mare and I was pretty impressed with my pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was nice. The pasta was much better, twice as big and better flavor that that of Scarpetta at the Cosmo for a few dollars less.\\n\\nSide Note:\\nWhile we were eating Carla was dining at a table right behind us with a guy in a suit. She is an attractive women and the pictures are accurate as to how she looks, not some stock photo from 1982 as many chefs and celebrities use. On several times during our meal she was talking and venting about her divorce of Frank Jr. from RAO's. Getting emotional as I can only imagine it had to be. I am always one to mind my own business unless someone makes it my business. I just feel it's inappropriate and unprofessional for a chef and owner to vent anything out where the public can hear or see her getting emotional about issues that the diners should have no business hearing. take it in the kitchen or stay home if you can't keep it together. It's easy to get caught up in emotion but as a professional there is a time and a place and your business isn't it. \\n\\nNow on for Dessert. We decide to share the the Tiramisu. I am a Tiramisu connoisseur. It is my favorite dessert of all time. Cannoli as well but Tiramisu is top of the pile. It is a dessert that had pretty specific ingredients yet every restaurant seems to have such drastically different consistency, flavor and presentation. That is also part of the intrigue of the dessert to me.  The portion size is fairly large and very nice presentation. It had 2 small cookies on the plate with the Tiramisu. The favor of the Tiramisu was different. Not in a bad way but not in the way that I prefer either. It was creamy but the coco and espresso favors didn't balance out right with the other flavors. It was not bad, it just wasn't as impressive as the rest of the dinner was.  The 2 cookies the size of a half dollar were the best part of the Tiramisu. So the star was not something you would really find traditionally. \\n\\nTo me the appetizers and meals were a solid 4 stars. Very good food. The server was decent, even though the server didn't seems to know his menu all that well. I had to ask the server for dessert instead of him suggesting it and trying to up sell. He was a nice and friendly guy, he could just use some more experience at Bacio. I would say he was about 40 so it wasn't for lack of experience in general, just at Bacio. The unprofessional behavior of Carla was a bit of a disappointment even though it didn't take away from the dinner.  For this reason I am giving it an over all of 3 stars because of the small downers even though it is easily a solid 4 star restaurant.maybe just an off night my date and I went. I love the name Bacio for the place too.</td>\n",

I even gave you two tries, just in case the first was a fluke. The first time, I ordered the burger wrap...it sounded like a good idea...but I didn't like it...at all. This time I decided to go with a cup of Tuscany soup (chili mac) and the noodle stir fry w/ a soy cafe mocha to wash it down.... \\n\\nLet me preface this by saying I ordered through Living Social's new delivery app. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it took 2 hours for my order to arrive, when I called the restaurant after 1 1/2 hours, the guy on the other line was very abrupt and said that the food would be here in less than 5 minutes...well, 5 minutes turned into 30 minutes.\\n\\nThe soup was pretty tasty, nothing incredible, but tasty. \\n\\nThe noodle stir fry was...kinda icky. It was somewhat soupy with charred/burnt pieces of chicken (which, strangely enough, was my favorite part...), overcooked veggies, undercooked pasta (or maybe that's just the wheat pasta texture...) and they completely forgot my cafe mocha (I wanted to cry....really I did). The guy that delivered seemed not terribly concerned and just shrugged it off saying that they'd remove it from my card.\\n\\nSorry, but this place just isn't cheap enough for me to be okay with you getting it wrong a 3rd time. \\n\\n...I know this sounds like a 1 star review, but I just don't have the heart to give them less than 2 for some reason...weird.</td>\n",
